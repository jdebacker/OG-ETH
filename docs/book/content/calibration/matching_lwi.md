# Matching Labor, Wealth, and Income Moments

As we note in Chapter {ref}`Chap_LfEarn`, we match the Gini coefficient of the income distribution through our calibration of the lifecyle productivity profile.  With survey data on hours worked by age, we can adjust the $\chi^n_s$ parameter to match the lifecycle profile of labor supply. The $\beta^j$ and $\chi^b_j$ parameters can be used to match the distribution of wealth given survey or administrative data describing its distribution.

## Average household income
We use the average household income parameter (`mean_income_data`) to map the tax functions in country currency to model units. The World Bank reported that Ethiopia had "a per capita gross national income of $1,020" in Fiscal Year 2023/2024.[^wb_avginc] This is equivalent to 157,845 ETB using the Nov. 17, 2025 exchange rate.
