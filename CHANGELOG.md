## [Unreleased]

### Changed
* Raised the Python floor to `>=3.12` (matching CI and ogcore's own `>=3.12` requirement; classifiers and the ruff target follow) and relocked to a single `ogcore 0.16.3`, matching OG-ZAF and OG-IDN. This removes the stale Python 3.11 resolution branch that pinned an older ogcore.
* Regenerated the baseline demographics in `ogeth_default_parameters.json` under ogcore 0.16.3, which reworks the pre-time-path population distribution (PSLmodels/OG-Core#1073): the transition-path arrays (`omega`, `g_n`, `imm_rates`, `rho`) shift by one period and three period-0 seeds (`g_n_preTP`, `imm_rates_preTP`, `rho_preTP`) are added.
* Limited the `update_from_api` macro calibration to the sources that are authoritative for Ethiopia: `g_y_annual` (World Bank WDI) and `gamma` (UN ILOSTAT) still update, while the World Bank QPSD debt pull and the IMF `alpha_T`/`alpha_G` pull are switched off (QPSD has no Ethiopia data; the IMF series returns only 2002 values). Debt ratios, `alpha_G`, `alpha_T`, and `r_gov_*` stay at the documented values in `calibration/macro.md`. This refreshes `g_y_annual` (0.060 → 0.0595) and `gamma` (0.518 → 0.517).

### Fixed
* Fixed the demographic `country_id` in `calibrate.py`, which pulled South Africa (UN code 710) data instead of Ethiopia (231), and regenerated the baseline demographics in `ogeth_default_parameters.json`. Steady-state population growth corrects from 0.4% to 2.0%; macro parameters are unchanged.
* Brought all installation instructions in line with the uv workflow the project migrated to in 0.1.0, matching the same fix in OG-PHL and OG-ZAF. The README now documents two supported paths, each as per-platform copy-paste blocks verified end to end: the OG family's universal installer (`install.sh --repo og-eth`, from PSLmodels/OG-Core) and a manual install (install uv, clone, `uv run python examples/run_og_eth.py`). The PyPI install section is dropped: `pip install ogeth` fails outright on the Python that ships with macOS (3.9), silently installs an ogcore older than the tested one on Python 3.11, and does not pin the tested ogcore even on a supported Python. The contributor guide and the UN tutorial no longer instruct readers to build the deleted `ogeth-dev` conda environment (`environment.yml` was removed in 0.1.0, so those steps failed at the first command); both now use `uv sync --extra dev` and `uv run`, the contributor guide's test command matches CI (`pytest -m "not local"` instead of OG-USA's `needs_puf` suite), stale `master`-branch references now say `main`, and the 3-period-model solutions page points at OG-ETH instead of OG-IDN.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-20 12:00:00

### Changed
* Migrated the project from conda to uv. Install with `uv sync --extra dev`; `pyproject.toml` is the single source of truth for dependencies and `uv.lock` pins exact versions.
* CI uses `astral-sh/setup-uv`, and ruff replaces black for formatting and linting (`check_format.yml` -> `check_ruff.yml`).
* Updated README, AGENTS.md, and the Makefile to the uv workflow.

### Removed
* `setup.py`, `environment.yml`, and `pytest.ini` (their settings moved into `pyproject.toml`).

## [0.0.8] - 2026-05-18 23:00:00

### Added
* Reads the SAM file from `ogeth/data/` instead of fetching it from GitHub at runtime, so offline runs work
* Adds a `pip-import-smoke` CI job that installs the package and imports it from a temp directory, catching packaging issues invisible from the source tree

### Fixed
* Fixes `alpha_c` to sum only the ten household columns of the SAM (instead of total - row, which included government, investment, and intermediate use), matching OG-IDN and OG-PHL

## [0.0.7] - 2026-05-12 00:50:00

### Fixed

- Fixed bug in `calibrate.py` where the `income.get_e_interp` function was not being called with the correct parameters. This was causing an error when running the `calibrate.py` script.

## [0.0.6] - 2026-04-15 15:50:00

### Added

- Updates connections to API calls to the World Bank, IMF, and UN in `macro_params.py` and `calibrate.py` to allow for updating the exogenous parameters from the APIs. This is currently set to `False` by default, but can be set to `True` to update the parameters from the APIs when running the `calibrate.py` script. The documentation in `exogenous_parameters.md` has also been updated to reflect this change.
- Updates how the SAM file is loaded in `input_output.py`
- Adds an `update_baseline.py` script that updates the default parameters in `ogeth_default_parameters.json` based on the output of the `calibrate.py` script. This allows us to easily update the default parameters in the JSON file when we run the calibration script.

## [0.0.5] - 2025-11-17 23:40:00

### Added

- Updates average household income `mean_income_data` to ETB 157,845 and the corresponding documentation in `matching_lwi.md`
- Updates initial debt-to-GDP and the corresponding documentation in `macro.md`

## [0.0.4] - 2025-11-17 18:30:00

### Added

- Updates the TPI resource constraint `RC_TPI=0.01`

## [0.0.3] - 2025-11-17 13:00:00

### Added

- Updates default parameters

## [0.0.2] - 2025-11-16 13:00:00

### Added

- Fixes black formatting in `income.py` and `input_output.py`
- Fixes a typo in `constants.py`
- Fixes an error in the `deploy_docs.yml` and `docs_check.yml` files
- Adds Jason as a core maintainer in `intro.md`. This also allows us to see if the documentation GH Actions work.
- Removed `test_income.py` and `test_input_output.py` tests

## [0.0.1] - 2025-11-16 12:30:00

### Added

- Adds 3 logo files to the `./docs/` directory: `OG-ETH_logo_gitfig.png`, `OG-ETH_logo_long.png`, and `OG-ETH_logo.png`.
- Updates a `.gitignore` file.
- Fixes references in `./docs/book/content/OGETH_references.md`, `./docs/create_doc_figures.py`, `PSL_catalog.json,` and `./docs/README.md`
- Fixes badges in `README.md` and `intro.md`
- Pins the `environment.yml` package `jupyter-book<2.0.0` so that the book can build with `jb build ...` command.
- Updates the functions in `input_output.rst` and `utils.rst`
- Updates the Jupyter metadata in `earnings.md` and `exogenous_parameters.md`. This is what was stopping the Jupyter Book from compiling (once we pinned `jupyter-book<2.0.0`).
- Adds GH Action files `build_and_tes.yml`, `check_format.yml`, `deploy_docs.yml`, `docs_check.yml`, `publish_to_pypi.yml`, `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md`, and `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`. These files required me to add OG-ETH to Codecov.io, add a repository secret for Codecov, create the gh-pages branch with the files for the Jupyter Book and publish it as a GitHub pages site, create and upload the first version of the `ogeth` package to PyPI.org, and add a repository secret for PYPI.

## [0.0.0] - 2025-10-06 12:00:00

### Added

- This version is a pre-release alpha. The example run script OG-ETH/examples/run_og_eth.py runs, but the model is not currently calibrated to represent the Ethiopian economy and population.
